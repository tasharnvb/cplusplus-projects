# My First C++ Project

This is what I have done while trying to learn C++.

I have mainly been watching and following along with C++ tutorials created by [Bucky Roberts (aka thenewboston) on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAE85DE8440AA6B83 "thenewboston's C++ Programming Playlist")

### Notes

* A lot of the code in main is commented out because I only wanted to run certain parts at certain times.

* The PythonCh2 files refer to the [Chapter 2 directory](https://github.com/tasharnvb/python-projects/tree/master/Python%20Programming%20Book/Chapter%202) in my python work. I just wanted to test and see if what I had previously learned in python transferred over.
    * Also, the `guessYourNumber` function is from [Guess Your Number 2.0](https://github.com/tasharnvb/python-projects/blob/master/Python%20Programming%20Book/Chapter%203/Guess%20Your%20Number%202.0.py) from the Chapter 3 directory in my python work.
